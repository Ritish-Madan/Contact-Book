# Contact Book

In this porject, I have built a contact book as the kickstart to my learning towards Node.JS. In the project, I have totally focused on the Back-end of the app, instead of beatufying the same. 

#### Dependencies

Well I have included the JSON file from which you can trace back the dependencies used in the project. So far the dependencies are:

1. **express** version 4.17.1
2. **mongoose** version 5.9.20
3. **nodemon** version 2.0.4
4. **ejs** version 3.1.3

These above are the dependencies used in the project. I have **used the MongoDB database** and accessed the same with Mongoose. The **view engine used is ejs** and express is the server side I have used. **Nodemon is actually an extension used so that when I make the changes to my JavaScript the server automatically refreshes and runs**, it is not necessary but something useful for developers.
